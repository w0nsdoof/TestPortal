# Migration Summary: Tests App Refactoring

## Overview

Successfully moved personalized questions logic and TestResult functionality from `users` and `questions` apps to the dedicated `tests` app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tests App (`tests/`)

- **models.py**: Added `TestResult` model with all business logic
- **serializers.py**: Created serializers for all test-related models
- **views.py**: Added all test-related views:
  - `personalized_questions`
  - `submit_answers`
  - `test_results_by_iin`
  - `test_results_by_iin_batch`
- **urls.py**: Created URL patterns for all test endpoints
- **admin.py**: Added admin configurations for all models

### 2. Users App (`users/`)

- **models.py**: Removed `TestResult` model
- **serializers.py**: Removed `TestResultSerializer`
- **views.py**: Removed test-related views:
  - `test_results_by_iin`
  - `test_results_by_iin_batch`
  - `submit_answers`
- **urls.py**: Removed test-related URL patterns

### 3. Questions App (`questions/`)

- **views.py**: Removed `personalized_questions` view
- **serializers.py**: Removed `AnswerSerializer` and `SubmitAnswersSerializer`
- **urls.py**: Removed personalized questions endpoint

### 4. Main Configuration

- **config/urls.py**: Added `tests/` URL patterns

### 5. Documentation

- **README_API_ENDPOINTS.md**: Updated to reflect new endpoint locations

## New API Endpoints

### Tests App Endpoints:

- `GET /tests/personalized/` - Get personalized questions
- `POST /tests/submit-answers/` - Submit test answers
- `GET /tests/results/` - Get test results by IIN
- `POST /tests/results/batch/` - Get test results for multiple IINs

### Removed Endpoints:

- `GET /questions/personalized/` (moved to tests)
- `POST /users/submit-answers/` (moved to tests)
- `GET /users/results/` (moved to tests)
- `POST /users/results/batch/` (moved to tests)

## Next Steps

1. Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations tests`
2. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Test all endpoints to ensure functionality is preserved
4. Update any frontend code to use new endpoint URLs

## Benefits

- Better separation of concerns
- Dedicated app for test-related functionality
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier maintenance and testing
