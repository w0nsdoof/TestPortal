There is an English square and there are pigeons to feed like in Trafalgar Square, London. There are four English-style pubs and you can buy English beer to drink. There is a canal and you can row a boat there like in Cambridge.\"\n\nAre there any cricket fields? \"No, there aren't any places to play cricket because nobody in Shanghai can play this game. But there is a football stadium like those in England. And the thing we are very proud of is our shopping street. There are several shops where you can buy traditional English food like fish and chips or Christmas Pudding.\"\n\nThe rich Shanghai businessman can do some gardening too. For with every house in \"English Town\", there is an English lawn and there are long gardens with ponds and tall hedges.\n\nBut there is one problem. The houses in this part of town cost a minimum of $400,000!",

    "paragraph": "Ingrid McFarlane Zoo Keeper\n\nWhen I left school at eighteen, I got a job at a zoo as a student keeper. Now, five years later, things have changed – I have passed my exams and I am a full animal keeper.\n\nThe money is not good. I only get £9,000 a year. You have to be outside in rain and snow, which is hard work, and you get very dirty. But this doesn't matter to me because animals are the most important thing in my life!\n\nThere are a hundred monkeys and fifty deer in my part of the zoo and I give them their food and clean their houses. I also need to watch them carefully to be sure that they are all well. In fact, rhinos are my favourite animals and so last year I went to Africa with a colleague for a month to study them.\n\nThe zoo is open every day and I work five different days each week. I live in a small flat twenty minutes away and I get up at ten to seven and start work at eight. The first thing I do when I get home at quarter past five is have a shower!",
