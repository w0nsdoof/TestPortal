If this occurs in a branch of the coronary artery supplying the heart muscle, that portion of the muscle dies, and the person experiences a painful and sometime fatal heart attack. Another danger of atherosclerosis is that pieces of the fatty deposits may break free and travel in the bloodstream until they lodge in small vessels and block the flow of blood.

The lack of healthy food, poor housing and lack of immunisation from diseases brings low working capabilities and, thus, have many impacts on children for the rest of their lives.
